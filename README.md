# Python-Fundamental

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive data analysis task involving employee data and project management.The dataset consists of three main tables: Employee Data, Seniority Level Data, and Project Data. Using Python and data manipulation libraries, various tasks were performed to clean, merge, analyze, and enhance the dataset, simulating real-world data challenges. The tasks range from handling missing values to applying business logic for project performance evaluation.

## Key Features

### 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- Imputed missing project costs using a running average with a for loop.
  
- Split the full name column into separate first and last name columns for improved data organization.

### 🔗 Data Merging and Aggregation

- Combined Employee, Seniority, and Project data into a single dataframe for a holistic analysis.

### 💰 Project Bonus Calculation

- Added a bonus column where employees who successfully completed projects received a 5% bonus based on project cost.

### 🧭 Designation Management

- Decreased the designation level of employees whose projects failed and removed records where designation exceeded level 4.
  
### 🔄 Data Transformation

- Applied appropriate titles ("Mr." and "Mrs.") based on gender and dropped the gender column to anonymize the data.
